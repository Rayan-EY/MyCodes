            <h1>About Our Contact List Webpage</h1>
            <p>This webpage is a Contact List application with the following features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Navigation Buttons:</strong> At the top of the page, there are two buttons, "Home" and "About." These buttons allow users to navigate to the home page or the about page respectively.</li>
        <br><li><strong>Contact Form:</strong> In the main content area, there is a contact form. Users can input their contact information, including Name, Email, and Phone number. Each field is marked as required to ensure users provide essential information.</li>
        <br><li><strong>Add Contact Button:</strong> Below the contact form, there is an "Add Contact" button. Clicking this button triggers the addition of a contact to the contact list.</li>
        <br><li><strong>Contact List:</strong> On the right-hand side, there is a section titled "Contact List." This is where added contacts are displayed. Initially, it appears empty, but as users add contacts, they will be listed here.</li>
        <br><li><strong>Search:</strong> Below the contact list, there is a search feature. Users can input a name into the "Search by Name" field and click the "Search" button to filter and display contacts with matching names.</li>
        <br><li><strong>Sort:</strong> Below the search feature, there is a "Sort Alphabetically" button. Clicking this button sorts the displayed contacts in alphabetical order by name.</li>
        <br><li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> The functionality of the page is powered by JavaScript. Functions like <code>addContact()</code>, <code>searchContacts()</code>, and <code>sortContacts()</code> are called when their respective buttons are clicked, allowing dynamic interaction with the contact list.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>About Time Complexities</h2>
        <h3>Linear Search</h3>
        <p>Linear search has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. It searches for a specific element by iterating through the list one element at a time until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.</p>

        <h3>Bubble Sort</h3>
        <p>Bubble sort has an average-case and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list. It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order until the entire list is sorted.</p>
